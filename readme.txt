= About instant@larm =
Whether your business is an e-commerce site or just an information site, it is essential that users are satisfied when they visit your site, so they will return another time. Studies show that 47 % of users expect a website is loaded and displayed in less than 2 seconds and if the time to display the website exceeds 3 seconds, 40 % of users leave the site before loading has finished. So the goal is not only to ensure 100 percent up-time, but also to reduce response time and act quickly when performance problems arise.

instant@larm from Digicure ensures that all parts of your website or ecommerce-site meet your performance requirements. If your site fails to meet your performance requirements, you will immediately receive an alarm, as a text message and as e-mail, so availability quickly can be restored.

Whether the responsibility of the website or webshop is outsourced, centralised in the organization or placed internally in the IT department, instant@larm is a online tool to make sure your site is always online. If your site performs poorly, whoever is responsible for the site’s performance, is immediately informed.
